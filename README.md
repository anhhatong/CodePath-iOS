# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Anh Tong (Maddie)**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Settings screen navigation
- [x] Set default tip percentages in settings screen
- [x] Update tip control with tip amount and total amount after setting new default tip percentages
- [x] Save default tip percentages across app restarts

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Saving and restoring new default percentages were challenging since I had to make sure new values and new calculation are updated. Also, it took me some time to navigate the storyboard features, such as the sent event settings and keyboard type.
